## Features

- Searchable single-select option lists with wrapped titles and descriptions
- Responsive split-pane details preview on wide terminals, with a persistent single-column preference
- Multi-select option lists
- Batches of 2-4 independent questions in one prompt, with a review page before submitting
- Optional freeform responses
- User-toggleable extra context on structured selections
- Context display support
- Responsive context collapse that keeps the question and choices visible on small terminals without discarding full context
- Configurable display mode: `overlay` (modal, default) or `inline` (rendered directly in the flow)
- Runtime overlay toggle: press the configured overlay-toggle key (`alt+o` by default, configurable per call or via env var) while the prompt is open to temporarily hide/show the popup so you can read prior agent output, then press it again to bring it back
- Pi-TUI-aligned keybinding and editor behavior
- Custom TUI rendering for tool calls and results
- System prompt integration via `promptSnippet` and `promptGuidelines`
- Optional timeout for auto-dismiss in both overlay and fallback input modes
- `herdr:blocked` lifecycle events while waiting for interactive input
- Structured response and cancellation `details` for session state reconstruction
- Graceful fallback when interactive UI is unavailable
- Bundled `ask-user` skill for mandatory decision-gating in high-stakes or ambiguous tasks

## Bundled skill: `ask-user`

This package now ships a skill at `skills/ask-user/SKILL.md` that nudges/mandates the agent to use `ask_user` when:

- architectural trade-offs are high impact
- requirements are ambiguous or conflicting
- assumptions would materially change implementation

The skill follows a "decision handshake" flow:

1. Gather evidence and summarize context
2. Ask one focused question via `ask_user`
3. Wait for explicit user choice
4. Confirm the decision, then proceed

See: `skills/ask-user/references/ask-user-skill-extension-spec.md`.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:pi-ask-user
```

## Tool name

The registered tool name is:

- `ask_user`

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `question` | `string?` | — | The question to ask the user. Each call needs exactly one of `question` or `questions` |
| `questions` | `{question, context?, options?, allowMultiple?, allowFreeform?}[]?` | — | 2-4 independent questions shown together, used instead of `question`. Set `context`, `options`, `allowMultiple`, and `allowFreeform` on each entry; passing them at the top level as well is an error. The remaining parameters apply to the whole batch. See [Asking several questions at once](#asking-several-questions-at-once) |
| `context` | `string?` | — | Relevant context summary shown before the question |
| `options` | `{title, description?}[]?` | `[]` | Multiple-choice options. The schema is a flat object shape (no `anyOf`, which some provider proxies strip or reject); plain strings and common alias keys (`label`, `text`, `value`, `name`, `option`) are still accepted at runtime |
| `allowMultiple` | `boolean?` | `false` | Enable multi-select mode |
| `allowFreeform` | `boolean?` | `true` | Add a "Type something" freeform option |
| `allowComment` | `boolean?` | env var or `false` | Expose a user-toggleable extra-context option in the custom UI (`ctrl+g` or the toggle row) and collect an optional comment in fallback dialogs |
| `displayMode` | `"overlay" \| "inline"?` | env var or `"overlay"` | Controls custom UI rendering: `overlay` shows the centered modal (current behavior), `inline` renders without overlay framing |
| `singleSelectLayout` | `"auto" \| "list"?` | env var or `"auto"` | Use the responsive details pane automatically or always render descriptions below their options |
| `contextExpanded` | `boolean?` | env var or `false` | Start with oversized context expanded. Per-call value overrides `PI_ASK_USER_CONTEXT_EXPANDED` |
| `overlayToggleKey` | `string?` | env var or `"alt+o"` | Shortcut for hiding/showing the overlay popup (overlay mode only). Pi-TUI key spec, e.g. `"alt+o"`, `"ctrl+shift+h"`. Pass `"off"` to disable. |
| `commentToggleKey` | `string?` | env var or `"ctrl+g"` | Shortcut for toggling the optional comment/extra-context row when `allowComment: true`. Pass `"off"` to disable. |
| `timeout` | `number?` | — | Auto-dismiss after N ms and return `null` if the prompt times out |

## Example usage shape

```json
{
  "question": "Which option should we use?",
  "context": "We are choosing a deploy target.",
  "options": [
    { "title": "staging" },
    { "title": "production", "description": "Customer-facing" }
  ],
  "allowMultiple": false,
  "allowFreeform": true,
  "allowComment": true,
  "displayMode": "inline"
}
```

`displayMode: "inline"` uses the same interaction logic but skips overlay mode when calling `ctx.ui.custom(...)`. RPC/headless fallback behavior is unchanged.

## Asking several questions at once

Use `questions` for 2-4 decisions that are independent of each other and whose prerequisites are already settled. Anything that depends on another answer belongs in a later `ask_user` call.

```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "Which database should the service use?",
      "context": "Both are supported by the ORM; the service is single-region.",
      "options": [
        { "title": "Postgres", "description": "Managed, JSONB support" },
        { "title": "SQLite", "description": "No extra infrastructure" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "question": "Which deploy target?",
      "options": [{ "title": "Fly.io" }, { "title": "Cloudflare" }],
      "allowFreeform": false
    },
    { "question": "Anything else we should know before starting?" }
  ],
  "timeout": 300000
}
```

The prompt shows one page per question plus a review page. Confirming a page records its answer and moves to the next unanswered question, then to the review page. `tab` / `shift+tab` switch pages without losing filters, drafts, or checked options, and number keys on the review page jump back to a question. Only the review page submits. If questions are still unanswered, the first press warns and a second press submits them as skipped. Questions without options open straight in a text editor.

In RPC/headless mode the questions are asked one after another with the fallback dialogs. There is no review page there, so cancelling any question cancels the whole batch.

## Personal preferences via environment variables

Configure your defaults globally by setting these in your shell profile (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.bash_profile`, etc.):

```bash
export PI_ASK_USER_DISPLAY_MODE=inline
export PI_ASK_USER_SINGLE_SELECT_LAYOUT=list
export PI_ASK_USER_ALLOW_COMMENT=true
export PI_ASK_USER_OVERLAY_TOGGLE_KEY=alt+h
export PI_ASK_USER_COMMENT_TOGGLE_KEY=alt+c
export PI_ASK_USER_CONTEXT_EXPANDED=true
```

Environment variables must be present in the process that launches Pi. If Pi is launched from a desktop app or a different shell, changes in `~/.zshrc` may not be inherited; launch Pi from a terminal where `echo $PI_ASK_USER_DISPLAY_MODE` shows the expected value.

### Display mode

Effective order:

1. Per-call `displayMode` parameter (if provided)
2. `PI_ASK_USER_DISPLAY_MODE` (if set to `"overlay"` or `"inline"`)
3. Fallback default: `"overlay"`

Unrecognised values are silently ignored and fall back to `"overlay"`.

### Single-select layout

Effective order:

1. Per-call `singleSelectLayout` parameter (if provided)
2. `PI_ASK_USER_SINGLE_SELECT_LAYOUT` (when set to `list`)
3. Fallback default: `auto`

`auto` shows the details pane on wide terminals. `list` keeps descriptions below their options at every width.

### Optional comments

Effective order:

1. Per-call `allowComment` parameter (if provided)
2. `PI_ASK_USER_ALLOW_COMMENT` (`true`, `1`, `yes`, or `on`; corresponding false values are also accepted)
3. Fallback default: `false`

### Context expansion

Oversized context collapses behind a one-line summary so the question and choices stay visible. To start expanded instead:

1. Per-call `contextExpanded` parameter (if provided)
2. `PI_ASK_USER_CONTEXT_EXPANDED` (`true`, `1`, `yes`, or `on`; corresponding false values are also accepted)
3. Fallback default: `false`

`ctrl+e` still toggles from whichever state the prompt opened in.

### Shortcuts

Effective order for both `overlayToggleKey` and `commentToggleKey`:

1. Per-call parameter (if provided)
2. Matching env var (`PI_ASK_USER_OVERLAY_TOGGLE_KEY` / `PI_ASK_USER_COMMENT_TOGGLE_KEY`)
3. Built-in defaults: `alt+o` and `ctrl+g`

Pass `"off"`, `"none"`, or `"disabled"` (at any level) to disable the shortcut entirely. Invalid specs are silently dropped and the next source is used. Specs follow the Pi-TUI [`KeyId`](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/blob/main/packages/tui/src/keys.ts) format: `[mod+]...key` where modifiers are `ctrl`, `shift`, `alt`, `super`, in any order, joined by `+` (e.g. `ctrl+g`, `alt+shift+x`, `escape`, `tab`).

## Controls

While an `ask_user` prompt is open:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `alt+o` (configurable via `overlayToggleKey`) | Hide/show the overlay popup so you can read the agent's prior output. Available in `overlay` mode only. The first time you hide it, a notification reminds you which key brings it back. |
| `ctrl+g` (configurable via `commentToggleKey`) | Toggle the optional comment/extra-context row (when `allowComment: true`). |
| `ctrl+e` | Expand or collapse oversized context while choosing an option. If another configured ask shortcut owns it, the prompt shows `ctrl+x` or `ctrl+y` instead. |
| `enter` | Confirm the focused option, submit a freeform response, or submit/skip an optional comment. In a batch, confirming records the answer; on the review page it submits. |
| `esc` | Clear the search filter, exit freeform/comment mode, or cancel the prompt. In a batch, cancelling cancels every question. |
| `↑` / `↓`, `ctrl+k` / `ctrl+j` | Navigate options. `ctrl+k` / `ctrl+j` (vim-style) work while typing in searchable prompts without disturbing the filter. On a batch's review page they scroll the answers. |
| `tab` / `shift+tab` | Single question: move down/up through the options. Batch: switch to the next/previous question or the review page. |
| `1`-`4` | Batch review page: jump back to that question. |

If you prefer never to see the overlay, set `displayMode: "inline"` per call or `PI_ASK_USER_DISPLAY_MODE=inline` globally.

### Cancellation

Aborting a tool call dismisses its active prompt, including freeform and RPC dialogs. Cancelling or timing out an optional RPC comment cancels the whole answer; press Enter with an empty comment to submit the selection without a comment.

The custom UI uses one timeout for the prompt. In the dialog fallback, the configured timeout applies separately to each dialog stage of a single question. A batch has one deadline for all of its questions, in the custom UI and in the dialog fallback.

### Mobile-sized terminals

If context wraps beyond the available decision area, `ask_user` collapses it into a one-line summary so the question and at least one choice remain visible. Press the context key shown in the prompt (`ctrl+e` by default) to expand or collapse the complete context; expanded context remains bounded and scrollable with the existing prompt-scroll keys in both display modes.

### Events

While an interactive prompt is open, the extension emits `herdr:blocked` with `{ active: true, label: "Waiting for user response" }`. It emits `{ active: false }` in `finally`, including cancellation and error paths. Hosts without a listener are unaffected.

When a displayed prompt resolves with an answer or cancellation, it emits `ask:answered` or `ask:cancelled`. Calls aborted before a prompt opens emit neither outcome event. Every installed extension receives these, so by default they carry only what is needed to correlate the prompt with its outcome:

```typescript
// ask:answered
{ question: string; response: { kind: "selection" | "freeform" } }
// ask:cancelled
{ question: string }
```

A batch publishes nothing until the user submits it. Then each answered question emits `ask:answered` and skipped questions emit nothing; a cancelled batch emits `ask:cancelled` for every question. Batch events carry the same payload plus the question's position:

```typescript
{ ...payload, batch: { index: number; total: number } }
```

Set `PI_ASK_USER_EMIT_FULL_EVENTS=true` (or `1`, `yes`, `on`) to restore the full payloads — `context`, the offered `options` on cancel, and the complete `response` including selections, comment, and freeform text. Leave it unset unless another extension you trust needs the answer itself; the full response is always available to the agent through the tool result's `details`.

## Known limitations

- **Overlays cannot draw over inline images** ([#8](https://github.com/edlsh/pi-ask-user/issues/8)). Pi-TUI's overlay compositor skips rows occupied by terminal images (Kitty/iTerm2 graphics), so an `ask_user` overlay that intersects an image is partially or fully invisible. This must be fixed upstream in pi-tui (`compositeLineAt` returns image rows unchanged). Until then, `displayMode: "inline"` (or `PI_ASK_USER_DISPLAY_MODE=inline`) sidesteps the overlay compositor entirely and should keep the prompt visible.

## Result details

Answers and cancellations include structured prompt `details` for rendering and session state reconstruction:

```typescript
type AskResponse =
  | { kind: "selection"; selections: string[]; comment?: string }
  | { kind: "freeform"; text: string };

interface AskToolDetails {
  question: string;
  context?: string;
  options: QuestionOption[];
  response: AskResponse | null;
  cancelled: boolean;
}
```

A `questions` batch returns separate details; the single-question shape above is unchanged:

```typescript
interface AskBatchDetails {
  kind: "batch";
  questions: Array<{ question: string; context?: string; options: QuestionOption[] }>;
  // Index-aligned with questions; empty when the batch was cancelled.
  answers: Array<{ status: "answered"; response: AskResponse } | { status: "skipped" }>;
  cancelled: boolean;
}
```

Malformed options, invalid `questions` batches, unavailable interactive UI, and UI failures throw so Pi records a failed tool call rather than a successful answer. These host-created error results do not guarantee either details shape. Error rendering also accepts older stored results with `details: { error: string }`.

## Automatic decisions for `ask_user` (fork feature)

This fork can optionally ask a separate OpenAI-compatible decision model to answer `ask_user` prompts. It supports single questions, multi-select, freeform answers when enabled, optional comments, and batches of 2-4 questions. For a batch in `auto` mode, every answer must validate and meet the confidence threshold; otherwise the entire batch stays interactive so the model never silently submits a partial batch.

### Configuration

Set these variables in the environment used to launch Pi:

```bash
export PI_ASK_USER_DECISION_MODE=off # off | ask | auto
export PI_ASK_USER_DECISION_THRESHOLD=0.85
export PI_DECISION_API_URL=https://your-provider.example/v1/chat/completions
export PI_DECISION_API_KEY=your-api-key
export PI_DECISION_MODEL=your-flash-model
```

The default mode is `off`. The decision endpoint must accept an OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions request, including JSON response format. The API key is read from the environment and is never written to session files or logs. Keep the endpoint and key private.

### Runtime commands

- `/decision status` — show current mode and whether a model is configured.
- `/decision off` — keep all prompts manual.
- `/decision ask` — show the model's suggestion, then keep the normal prompt for manual selection.
- `/decision auto` — automatically submit a validated selection, multi-selection, or allowed freeform answer only when confidence meets the configured threshold (default `0.85`). For batches, every answer must pass validation and threshold checks.

Commands change the mode for the current Pi process only. Use `PI_ASK_USER_DECISION_MODE` for the startup default. If the provider is unavailable, returns invalid JSON, proposes invalid choices, returns `NEEDS_HUMAN`, or falls below the threshold, the normal manual prompt is shown. Requests time out after 10 seconds. Multi-select answers are checked against exact option titles and the `allowMultiple` setting; freeform answers are accepted only when `allowFreeform` is enabled. The model receives only the current question(s), supplied context, available options, and short fixed constraints—not the full Pi conversation.
